# Cinema Q&A System

Domain Specific Language, written in [ANTLR](https://www.antlr.org/), that tries to simutate a question and answers system. The grammer produced recognizes different keywords written in a TXT file, refered as "knowledge base", which contains the different keywords for the questions and respective answers. The main area of knowledge is cinema/film culture.

## Usage

The DSL was produced using [ANTLRWorks 2](http://tunnelvisionlabs.com/products/demo/antlrworks), based on the NetBeans editor. As a result, there is no command line tool available to test the DSL. With this in mind, it is only possible to test the DSL using the editor, as it reads the input from the TXT file.
